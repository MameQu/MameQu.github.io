Description: Chasing Rainbows
Opening:
Let me into your heart
Whoo

Intro:
Starting out my day feeling weary and blue
Going out of my way finding something to do
Then A chance
Found you sitting there
I asked
What's the matter dear
Is there anything I can do

Refrain:
With a glance
You stole my breath away

Chorus:
Whenever there's a place in your heart
I'll be down here waiting for 
your precious time
running around
in circles
I'll always be to your beck in call
Trust
whatever I can do
Must
be someone you can rely on

A second is all I need
and I'll be there in a heartbeat

Trust
We were made for each other
Love 
I promise you always and forver
A second is all I need
and I'll be there...
I'll be there in a heartbeat
whoa a oh o o

BPM:80
Intro:
Going through the trenches
As the image of you faded

I miss the sound of your voice

Chorus:
Last of my life
Set flame to the world tonight
Deep in my soul
We fly

Bright is the day 
As my soul takes a final breath
So I may lay
by your side
